# Three-Layer-NN-SciKit
In this project I implemented a fully connected three layer neural network using sklearn's neural network packages, and trained it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The tar file needs to be downloaded into the root folder from: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html. 

It takes a very long time to train on cpu, as expected. The results after running it from the python shell are included in the screenshot "Run_results".
