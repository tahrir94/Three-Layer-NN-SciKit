# Three-Layer-NN-SciKit
In this project I implemented a fully connected three layer neural network using sklearn's neural network packages, and trained it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It takes a very long time to train on cpu, as expected. The results after running it from the python shell are included in the screenshot "Run_results".
